 * <p> Description: The Java/FX-based Admin Home Page.  This class provides the controller actions
 * basic on the user's use of the JavaFX GUI widgets defined by the View class.
 * 
 * This page contains a number of buttons that have not yet been implemented.  WHen those buttons
 * are pressed, an alert pops up to tell the user that the function associated with the button has
 * not been implemented. Also, be aware that What has been implemented may not work the way the
 * final product requires and there maybe defects in this code.
 * 
 * The class has been written assuming that the View or the Model are the only class methods that
 * can invoke these methods.  This is why each has been declared at "protected".  Do not change any
 * of these methods to public.</p>
